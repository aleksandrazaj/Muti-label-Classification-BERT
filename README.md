# Muti-label-Classification-BERT
NLP fine-tuning of BERT for specific use case and multi-label classification architecture

Includes:
- Data Engineering steps for pre training
- BERT Fine Tuning code (for multi-label specificts - categories and sentiment at once)
- Evaluation on new data / post-data processing

Published part of project which was reused for my Master Thesis "Does Specific Chatter Matter? Leveraging User Generated Content for experiential product performance.
